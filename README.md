# SpaceShield: Radiation Mitigation for Space Missions

SpaceShield is a Rust package designed to offer solutions and strategies for mitigating radiation risks in space environments. Leveraging Rust's performance and safety features, SpaceShield provides tools for analyzing, predicting, and managing radiation exposure to protect both hardware and human health in space missions.

## Features

- **Radiation Simulation**: Simulate radiation exposure scenarios based on mission parameters to help in planning and protective measures.
- **Shielding Optimization**: Algorithms to optimize shielding materials and configurations for spacecraft and habitats.
- **Health Risk Assessment**: Tools to assess and predict health risks due to radiation exposure for astronauts.
- **Hardware Protection**: Strategies and algorithms to protect spacecraft hardware and computers from radiation-induced failures.
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Support for real-time radiation monitoring data integration and risk assessment.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Rust installed on your system. Visit [The Rust Programming Language](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) website for installation instructions.

### Installation

Add SpaceShield to your project's `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
spaceshield = "0.1.0"
```

Then, in your project, add:

```rust
extern crate spaceshield;
```

### Quick Example

```rust
use spaceshield::radiation_simulation::RadiationSimulator;

fn main() {
    let simulator = RadiationSimulator::new();
    let risk_report = simulator.simulate_exposure("Mars", 180);
    println!("Risk Report: {:?}", risk_report);
}
```
