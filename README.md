# SpaceShield: Advanced Radiation Mitigation for Space Missions

SpaceShield is a comprehensive Rust package designed to mitigate radiation risks in space environments, focusing on both human health and technology protection. Utilizing Rust's performance and safety features, SpaceShield provides advanced tools for analyzing, predicting, managing radiation exposure, and ensuring the reliability of onboard computer systems through error-correcting code (ECC) memory support and redundancy strategies.

## Features

- **Radiation Simulation**: Simulate radiation exposure scenarios based on mission parameters to aid in planning and protective measures.
- **Shielding Optimization**: Algorithms to optimize shielding materials and configurations for spacecraft and habitats.
- **Health Risk Assessment**: Tools to assess and predict health risks due to radiation exposure for astronauts.
- **Hardware Protection**: Strategies and algorithms to protect spacecraft hardware and computers from radiation-induced failures, including support for ECC memory and redundancy systems.
- **Error-Correcting Code (ECC) Memory Support**: Implements ECC memory algorithms to detect and correct single-bit errors, significantly reducing the risk of data corruption and system failures caused by radiation-induced bit flips.
- **Redundancy Systems**: Provides frameworks for designing and implementing redundant systems to ensure mission-critical operations can continue even in the event of hardware failure due to radiation exposure.
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Support for integrating real-time radiation monitoring data for ongoing risk assessment and mitigation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Rust installed on your system. Visit [The Rust Programming Language](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) website for installation instructions.

### Installation

Add SpaceShield to your project's `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
spaceshield = "0.1.0"
```

Then, in your project, add:

```rust
extern crate spaceshield;
```

### Quick Example

```rust
use spaceshield::{radiation_simulation::RadiationSimulator, hardware_protection::EccMemory};

fn main() {
    let simulator = RadiationSimulator::new();
    let risk_report = simulator.simulate_exposure("Mars", 180);
    println!("Risk Report: {:?}", risk_report);

    let ecc_memory = EccMemory::new();
    ecc_memory.protect_data(&mut data);
    println!("Data protected with ECC: {:?}", data);
}
```
